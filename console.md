## Text Editors

### What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is a piece of software on your computer or in your browser through which you can write and manage text.
Some important features are
  - code completion
  - syntax highlighting
  - theme variety
  - various available extentions
  - 
### Using your Computer's Software

Mac computers come with 'Text Edit" and Windows come with "Notepad", which are both text editors, which you can try over downloading a new program, but they're very bare in terms of features. If you are using these, they must be used in plain text (no bold italics or the likes) and all of your code should go in a single file with appropriate extensions.

### The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs

while a text editor edits text, an IDE (Integrated Developement Environment) mixes together a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger.
