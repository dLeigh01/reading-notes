SQL (structured Query Language) is designed to allow technical and non-technical users to interface with data from a relational database, which represents a collection of related tables with a fixed number of named columns and any number of data rows.

## SQL Queries

A query, or a **SELECT** statement is used to retrieve data from a SQL database by stating what we are looking for, where to find it, and what may need to happen to it before it is returned. A basic query would take on the structure of

`SELECT column, another_column, ...`

`FROM mytable;`

or, alternatively, you would use an asterisk in the SELECT portion of the query to select all of the columns.

To add a constraint to your search, you would add a **WHERE** statement to your query, ex.

`WHERE condition(s)`

After your **WHERE** statement, you can add extra conditions such as **AND**, **OR**, **BETWEEN... AND...**, **NOT BETWEEN... AND...**, **IN(...)**, **NOT IN(...)**, and standard numerical operators for anything involving numbers.

When dealing with characters, you can use the standard equality/inequality comparison operators, along with _, %, **LIKE**, **NOT LIKE**, **IN(...)**, and **NOT IN(...)**.

If you don't want anything with duplicate values, you would use `SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column`, which filters out results that have the same value in the selected column.

To put your results in any specific order, you would add `ORDER BY column ASC/DESC` at the end of your query. This sorts the rows alphanumerically based on the value of the data contained in the column. Following **ORDER BY**, you can also add `LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset` which indicates the subset of results you're looking for. **LIMIT** reduces the number of rows returned and **OFFSET** specifies where to begin counting from.

Database normalization minimalizes duplicate data in any single table and allows for data to grow independantly. Tables with shared information will have a primary key linking them which can be used with **JOIN** to combine row data across two separate tables. **INNER JOIN** matches rows from the first and second table with the same key, defined by **ON** to create a results row with the combined columns from the two tables.
