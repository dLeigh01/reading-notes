## Explaining REST

1. Roy Fielding helped to write the first web servers.
2. Techniques today don't work when we need to talk to all the machines in the world because they don't have a universal way of communicating nouns.
3. The HTTP protocol created by Fielding uses GET to obtain things based on their URL (it applies verbs to nouns).
4. GET looks for a computer-readable resource.
5. POST adds something to another system.
6. PUT replaces something in another system.
7. PATCH partially updates something in another system.
