## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

The modern computer science industry is mainly dominated by men, but women made up a good portion of the people who programmed the first digital computers and for decades the amount of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. In 1984, the percentage of women in computer science started to fall at the same time the personal computer came into existence, which was marketed almost exclusively to males. Colleges began assuming that students had already been using computers and would no longer have intro classes at the same level, leaving women who had grown up without computers to fall behind.

1. At the same time the decline began, personal computers were showing up in people's homes.
2. Since males had played on computers growing up, they had a head start in understanding how to use computers as a whole and that changed the way classes were run.
