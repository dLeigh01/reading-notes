## The Command Line

A command line is an interface that takes in and returns data strictly through text. It typically will present you with a prompt and your response will be displayed after it. Terminals have something called a shell, which defines how the terminal appears and behaves.

A helpful shortcut is that you can go back through commands you have entered using the arrow keys rather than retyping them every time.

## Basic Navigation

- `pwd` (Print Working Directory) is a command that tells you what your current working directory is.
- `ls` (list) lists all files and directories within your current directory. You also can add `[options][location]` following it for more complex outputs, such as `-l` for a long listing or `/etc` to list the contents of a directory rather than the directory itself.

A path is a way to reach a particular file or directory. Absolute paths (which always being with a `/`) specify a location in relation to the root directory while relative paths specify a location in relation to you current directory. The root directory is the very top of your file hierarchy and is denoted by a single `/`.

- `~` is the shortcut to reach your home directory.
- `.` refers to your current directory.
- `..` refers to the direct parent of your current directory.

`cd [location]` (change directory) is the command used to move between directories. You can either run it with a target directory, or you can just run `cd`, which will return you to your home directory.

A helpful shortcut is tab completion, which allows you to hit tab to auto-complete a path while you are typing it rather than writing out the entire path yourself.

*I was previously unaware that you could add options to `ls` other than `-a` so that is something I will need to look into more for future use.*

## More About Files

Everything in linux exists as a file, whether it is an actual file or your monitor. Linux is also an extensionless system, which means that it looks inside a file to determine what it is rather than reading the extension that follows it. This can make it difficult to determine the type of some files, but the command `file [path]` will let you know. Linux is also case sensitive, so you can have multiple files with names that are spelled the same, but have slightly different casing. Spaces are a valid part of naming conventions for files in linux, but the terminal will not be able to find them just by typing the name as usual, you instead would need to either surround the name in quotes to refer to it, or use an escape character `\` before the space to tell the terminal to ignore its normal meaning (If you use tab completion before the space, the terminal will automatically escape any spaces in the name).

If you want a file to be hidden, all you need to do is start the name with `.`. By default, `ls` will not show hidden files, but adding the `-a` option will show the hidden files as well as the visible ones.
