# What is CSS?

CSS (cascading style sheets) is a way to style how your web page looks.

## Browser Defaults

the browser contains its own style sheet, which ensures all of the different tags work the way they are supposed to on their own, but you can change all of it with css.

## What is CSS For?

CSS specifies how documents appear to users.
- a document is a text file made with something like HTML
- presenting a document means putting it in a form usable by your audience

CSS can do things like change the color of text on a page or move around the layout

## CSS Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language, which means you specify which groups different styles should apply to.

a CSS rule is written as something like `h1 { color: red; }`

## CSS Modules

CSS is broken up into different modules, such as Backgrounds and Borders, which makes it easier to look up different properties.

## CSS Specifications

all web standards technologies are defined in documents called specifications, which define how they are meant to behave. CSS is developed by the CSS Working Group and they make new CSS features as time goes on, but don't update it in a way that would break old sites using it.

## Browser Support Information

new features often don't take effect in all browsers at the same time, so you can check whether features are included using 'Browser Compatability'.
