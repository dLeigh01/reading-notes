# Django Models

Understanding Django will be important moving forward because Django is a major framework that is used in many applications and knowing how to use it will be good for our career transition.

## Getting Started with Django

With Django, you get many helpful abilities:

- Object-relational mapper: You can define your data models in Python, but still use SQL if need be
- URLs and views: Django encourages clean URL design without any add-ons using URLconfs that act as a table of contents for the app
- Templates: Django templates are designed to be easy to use if you already know HTML, as well as highly flexible.
- Forms: The form library provided with django handles user-submitted data, renders HTML forms, and converts all of it into native Python types. All in all, it provides a handy way to generate and update data.
- Authentication: Django comes with a secure authentication system that allows you to easily handle user safety
- Admin: Django has an automatic admin interface that reads your metadata to provide an immediate content management interface with easy set-up and customization
- Internationalization: Django offers full translation support and will convert any necessary dates/times etc between locales, allowing the delveloper to specify which things should be formatted for different languages and cultures.
- Security: Django provides protection against clickjacking, cross-site scraping, cross site request forgery, SQL injection, and remote code execution

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

Django is an open source web framework based in Python that was originally developed in 2005 and is still under active development today with major releases every nine months. The two major issues that come up form Django are funding and control. The problem with funding is that, even though developers are often willing to devote time and effort to open source projects for free, there are other parts that will always cost something, such as trademark and legal disputes, managing releases, keeping track of support tickets, etc. Most open source projects get their funding in one of three ways:

- A corporate sponsor
- Solo
- Non-profit

Django comes out of a non-profit, the Django Software Foundation (DSF), which supports and maintains the project. The largest expense that comes out of the projects is paying for the Fellows Program, which is a group of paid contractors that do the necessary work to keep Django on track. The total budget yearly for the DSF is around $200k. While the DSF handles all the legal, financial, and administrative matters, there is a separate technical team. In the past, all technical disputes came down to the project founders, but when they retired in 2014, a team of core members was created and divided up to take over authority over the infrastructure of the Django project.

### Discussion

Knowing that django was part of an earlier build of instagram makes it very intersting to learn what's behind it and how you could use it yourself for larger-scale projects than what we've been working with.
