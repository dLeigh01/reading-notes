## Whiteboard Advice

Whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking a candidate to solve technical questions on a piece of paper or computer during the interview. The best piece of advice for this technical part of the interview is to communicate. You should start by restating the question to ensure you understand it correctly, then you should inquire about possible edge cases, and how they would like you to handle them. Check whether there are any specific test cases they would like the solution to pass. Now you can step into a pseudocode algorithm and again check if your solution makes sense to them. Finally, you should write out the actual code and ask if it looks good. If at any point you are having difficulty, it is always okay to ask for help, as long as you're conversational about it. As a bonus, if you can, have some communication before the interview comes up.

## 7 Tips

1. Take your time - take a moment to think through the problem before you start talking to allow you brain time to run through it without distraction.
2. Write down the steps of the solution - write an algorithm of some sort where it won't get in the way to keep track of what needs to happen in your actual code.
3. Write pseudocode first - give your algorithm a go in pseudocode to hopefully run into any issues early and fix them before you hit the actual code.
4. Don't sweat the small stuff - programming interviews are about showing off your knowledge, not whether you forgot a semicolon somewhere.
5. Sit down, be humble - a programming interview is an assessment of your abilities, and that extends beyond how well you code. For example, how well do you take criticism?
6. Come prepared - you want to maximize your preparedness so you always know you've done the best you possibly could've.
7. Review your work - you won't always have time to finish, but if you do happen to have extra time at the end, be sure to go back over everything you've written and make certain it is your best work.
