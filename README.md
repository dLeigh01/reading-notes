## Introduction

  My name is Dana, I'm 23, I'm an artist, and I believe that code is just an extension of artistry into a diferent field than I'm used to. If there's one thing I can say I truly enjoy about code, it's the fact that you can use so many different ways to get to the same results, and all ~~read: most; here's looking at you code with no notes~~ of those ways are equally valid, if not more or less complicated.
  
  I know it's saying alot when people profess that they want to *change the world* or *redefine the industry* or what have you; honestly I'm not sure where I want this path to take me, but I do know that all I've wanted for a while now is to start walking and just see where I end up. Maybe I end up doing something small, or go to the DOD like my uncle suggested, or I suppose there's a possibility I do end up creating something amazing. Whatever it is, I'm just excited to get out of retail and find something more to do with my life.
