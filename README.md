  - If something takes effort, it means you're getting better

## Introduction

  My name is Dana, I'm 23, I'm an artist, and I believe that code is just an extension of artistry into a diferent field than I'm used to. If there's one thing I can say I truly enjoy about code, it's the fact that you can use so many different ways to get to the same results, and all ~~read: most; here's looking at you code with no notes~~ of those ways are equally valid, if not more or less complicated.
  
  I know it's saying alot when people profess that they want to *change the world* or *redefine the industry* or what have you; honestly I'm not sure where I want this path to take me, but I do know that all I've wanted for a while now is to start walking and just see where I end up. Maybe I end up doing something small, or go to the DOD like my uncle suggested, or I suppose there's a possibility I do end up creating something amazing. Whatever it is, I'm just excited to get out of retail and find something more to do with my life.

## Markdown Syntax

 - Headings start the line with 1-6 # (the lowest amount giving the largest heading) and automatically create a directory
 - bold text is surrounded by `** **` or `__ __`
 - italicized text is surrounded by `* *` or `_ _`
 - strikethroughs are created with `~~ ~~`
 - you can nest bold and italics with the same commands
 - bold and italicize words with `*** ***`
 - to quote text, preceed it with a `>`
 - to quote code, use \` \`
 - to create a link, `[surround your text with these](and put the hyperlink here)`
 - you can change that to an image by adding an `!` to the start
 - you can create unordered lists using `-` or `*`
 - ordered lists only need be preceeded by a number
 - lists are nestable by adding spaces until the `-` is just below the first character of the previous line
 - for a task list, use `[ ]` for incomplete items and `[x]` for complete
 - you can use mentions with `@` followed by a username
 - typing `#` will bring up a list of pull requests
 - you can use emojis with `: :`
