# CRUD

It is important to learn the different status codes so you know what to send/ what ones you are being sent mean and also its good to go again over linking up with a database to be sure you've got it clear.

## Status Codes Based on REST Methods

An HTTP status code is a number between 100 and 600 that is part of an HTTP response. The first digit denotes the class of the response and it comes with a reason phrase.

Status classes:

- 100-199: Informational - part of the request has been recieved and the server will attempt to comply.
- 200-299: Success - the request was accepted.
- 300-399: Redirection - the resource requested is not available at the expected location, and the client must redirect.
- 400-499: Client Error - an invalid request was sent to the server.
- 500-599: Server Error - the server is overwhelmed or unreachable.

CRUD (create, read, update, delete) is a model defining the most basic API actions for persistant storage.

- Create
  - 200 - OK
  - 201 - Created
  - 202 - Accepted
  - 303 - See Other
- Read
  - 200 - OK
  - 206 - Partial Content
  - 300 - Multiple Choices
  - 304 - Not Modified
  - 307 - Temporary Redirect
  - 308 - Permanent Redirect
- Update
  - 200 - OK
  - 202 - Accepted
  - 204 - No Content
- Delete
  - 200 - OK
  - 202 - Accepted
  - 204 - No Content
- API Changes
  - 307 - Temporary Redirect
  - 308 - Permanent Redirect
- Multiple Endpoints for One Resource
  - 308 - Permanent Redirect

Errors are another important section of status codes

- Wrong URL
  - 307 - Temporary Redirect
  - 308 - Permanent Redirect
  - 404 - Not Found
  - 405 - Method Not Allowed
  - 406 - Not Acceptable
  - 410 - Gone
  - 414 - Request URI Too Long
  - 501 - Not Implemented
- No Permissions
  - 401 - Unauthorized
  - 403 - Forbidden
  - 404 - Not Found

1. 100s, the server is acknowledging your request - 200s, the server has accepted your request - 300s, the server needs you to go somewhere else - 400s, the client has messed something up - 500s, the server has messed something up.
2. 202 is Accepted
3. 308 is a permanent redirect
4. If an update didn't return data, you would return 204.
5. If a resource used to exist, but no longer does you would use 410.
6. Forbidden is 403

## Build a Rest API

1. Because we don't want the database link pushed to github.
2. Middleware runs between when the server recieves a request and passes it to a route.
3. Lets the server accept json as a body.
4. It is a parameter.
5. Patch only updates based on what is passed in, while Put updates everything.
6. You put in a default key in the object.
7. 500 meanse there's an error on the server.
8. 201 meanse successfully created an object, 200 is a more generic success.
