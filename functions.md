# Functions and Operators

## Control Flow

the control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code runs in order from the first line to the last unless it hits something like a loop or a function call that changes the structure.

## Javascript Functions

a function is a block of code designed to do a specific task, and it is executed when something invokes it.

### Javascript Function Syntax

`function NAME(parameters){ code here }` is the way to write a function.
- parameters are listed in the parenthesis
- arguments are the values recieved by the function when its invoked

### Function Invocation

`return` is the command to stop executing the function, and the code listed after return will become the return value, which is given back to the 'caller'.

### Why Functions?

you can define the code once and use it in many different spots with different results.

### The () Operator Invokes the Function

the name of a function followed by parenthesis will return the result, while using no parenthesis will return the function object.

### Functions Used as Variable Values

functions can be used in the same manner of variables in all the same situations.

### Local Variables

variables declared within a function can only be accessed from within that function. Because of this, the same variable name can be used in multiple functions.

## Javascript Operators

- `=` assigns a value to a variable
- `+` adds numbers or concatenates strings
- `*` multiplies numbers
- `-` subtracts numbers
- `**` exponentiates
- `/` divides numbers
- `%` gives the division remainder
- `++` increments numbers
- `--` decrements numbers
- `==` is equal to
- `===` equal value AND type
- `!=` not equal to
- `!==` not equal value OR type
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `?` ternary operator
- `&&` logical and
- `||` logical or
- `!` logical not
- `typeof` returns the type of a variable
- `instanceof` returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `~` NOT
- `^` XOR
- `<<` left shift
- `>>` right shift
- `>>>` unsigned right shift
