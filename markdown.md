# Markdown Syntax

 - Headings start the line with 1-6 # (the lowest amount giving the largest heading) and automatically create a directory
 - bold text is surrounded by `** **` or `__ __`
 - italicized text is surrounded by `* *` or `_ _`
 - strikethroughs are created with `~~ ~~`
 - you can nest bold and italics with the same commands
 - bold and italicize words with `*** ***`
 - to quote text, preceed it with a `>`
 - to quote code, use \` \`
 - to create a link, `[surround your text with these](and put the hyperlink here)`
 - you can change that to an image by adding an `!` to the start
 - you can create unordered lists using `-` or `*`
 - ordered lists only need be preceeded by a number
 - lists are nestable by adding spaces until the `-` is just below the first character of the previous line
 - for a task list, use `[ ]` for incomplete items and `[x]` for complete
 - you can use mentions with `@` followed by a username
 - typing `#` will bring up a list of pull requests
 - you can use emojis with `: :`
 - footnotes are referenced using `[^1]` and created using `[^1]:`
 - you can comment out content using `<!-- -->`
 - markdown formatting is ignorable by prefacing each symbol with a `\`
