## NoSQL vs SQL

High-level differences -

- SQL databases are called RDBMS (relational databases) while NoSQL databases are called non-relational or distributed databases.
- SQL databases are table based while NoSQL ar document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
- SQL databases have predefined schema while NoSQL have dynamic structures.
- SQL databases are vertically scaleable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) while NoSQL databases focus queries on collections of documents.

1. The best data for a SQL database is a table.
2. A real world example of SQL data is a group of things all under one heading, like products.
3. The best data for a NoSQL database is key-value pairs.
4. A real world example of good NoSQL data is JSON.
5. NoSQL
6. SQL

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language
2. A database that works in a specific way with SQL
3. it works with tables
4. the defined fields for the data
5. can store lots of data efficiently
6. uses collections rather than tables
7. documents in a similar form to JSON
8. MongoDB, you can change which data you're getting as you go, and still have it in the same collection with no relations.
9. You can't rely on your record having a specific field since it is schema-less.
