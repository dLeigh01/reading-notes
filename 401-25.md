# Permissions & PostgreSQL

Permissions will be important in any real life project so that not-just-anyone can come in and mess with your database

## DRF Permissions

Permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access. Permission checks run before any other code and will typically use the `request.user` and `request.auth` properties to make it's determination. The simplest style of permission is to allow any authenticated user access to anything and deny access to all unauthenticated users. The REST framework has a built-in `IsAuthenticated` class to facilitate this. Permissions themselves are defined as a list of classes. If a permissions check fails, an exception will be raised and return either a 403 or 401 response. REST framework also allows Object-level permissions, which determine whether a user should be able to interact with specific objects based on their permissions. You can set the default permissions in the `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` setting. By default, this is set to all users, but you can change it to `IsAuthenticated`. You also can set it on a per-view basis using the `APIView` class-based views.

- `AllowAny` will allow unrestricted access
- `IsAuthenticated` will deny any unauthenticated used
- `IsAdminUser` will deny permission unless `user.is_staff` is True
- `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` will allow authenticated users to perform any request and unauthenticated users to only perform 'safe' requests.
- `DjangoModelPermissions` will only grant access if the user has relevent model permissions
- `DjangoObjectPermissions` will only grant access if the user has relevent model and object permissions

You could also create custom permissions by overriding `BasePermission`.

### Things I'd Like to Know More About

creating custom permissions

### Discussion

I would assume this will be slightly similar to how we used OAuth, but a more built in version, which should be interesting.
