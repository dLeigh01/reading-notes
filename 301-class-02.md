# State and Props

## React Lifecycle

React allows you to define components as classes or functions, and the methods that you can use on them, which can be called during the lifecycle of a component and allow you to update the UI and application status, are called lifecycle events. The three phases of the component lifecycle are

- mounting - when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
- updating - anytime a component is updated or state changes causing it to rerender.
- unmounting - when a component is being removed from the DOM.

The `constructor()` for a React component is called before mounting occurs. If it is a subclass, you also need to call `super(props)`. Constructors can use `this.state` to assign state or can bind event handlers to an instance.

The only method actually required in a class component is `render()`, which examines `this.state` and `this.props` whenever it is called.

`componentDidMount()` runs after a component is mounted and should be used to load anything using a network request or to initialize the DOM.

If you set `shouldComponentUpdate()` to false, it won't automatically rerender after every state change, which helps to optimize performance.

`componentDidUpdate()` is used to perform network requests after a change has occurred.

`componentWillUnmount()` allows you to clean up the DOM/network requests.

1. Based on the diagram, the render happens before componentDidMount.
2. The first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is mounting.
3. Constructor -> Render -> React Updates -> componentDidMount -> componentWillUnmount
4. componentDidMount runs after a component is mounted and is used for network requests and DOM initialization.

## React State Vs Props

- Props - arguments to a function, best for initializing components and can rerender components if the props change, cannot change things outside the component from within the component
- state - handled inside the component, manages things within the component and can be updated within the component, rerenders when things change within the component

1. You can pass in arguments through props.
2. The big difference between props and state is that props is managed outside the component while state is managed within it.
3. We rerender our application whenever something is changed.
4. An example of something you could store in state is a counter.

## Things I want to know more about

What exactly are network requests/subscriptions in the context this article is using them?
