## CRUD Basics

CRUD (create read update delete) represents the four basic functions that models should be able to do and are considered necessary in a persistant storage application. When we create something, it makes a new object that we can then post to our API. After it has been posted, the API should allow you to read that data using a get request. Once data exists, you can update it using put, which replaces all of the current data. You can also use the delete method to remove existing data.

1. To update a record through API you would use PUT
2. Delete and Put both require IDs

## Building a CRUD API

1. REST is a design style for APIs and CRUD is an acronym for the operations that should be performable by a RESTful API
2. Create a basic API, give it all the necessary routes, link it to a database, give all of the routes the necessary code to work, then test for correct values and error handling.
