# Serverless Functions

Learning about Serverless is important because we should know all of our options in terms of backend to know what is the best for any given application we may create.

## What is Serverless Computing

Serverless is a cloud application development model that allows users to build and run code without needing to manage servers. The cloud service provider will scale the infrastructure as needed, allowing the developer to focus more on the front end code and removing the need to pay for idle capacity. Serverless computing doesn't actually have no servers, but the user doesn't need to ever interact with them. FaaS (Function as a Service) is the model central to service and enables users to run code or dontainers in response to specific events without needing to specify the required infrastructure. In addition to FaaS, serverless also includes Serverless databases and storage, event streaming and messaging, and API gateways. Between Serverless and PssS, containers and VMs, serverless has far better provisioning time, no administrative burden, no maintenance, automatic scaling, no capacity planning, inherent statelessness, inherent high availability and disaster recovery, 100% efficient resource utilization, and savings in how it is billed. It is better in pretty much every way.

Now the actual list of pros and cons - pros

- Improved developer productivity
- Pay for execution only
- Develop in any language
- Streamlined development and DevOp cycles
- Cost effective performance
- Usage visibility

Cons

- Unacceptable latency for certain applications
- Higher costs on stable or predictable workloads
- Monitoring and debugging issues
- Vendor lock-in

### Things I Want to Know More About

At what point does it become more expensive to use serverless than managing your own server?

### Discussion

Serverless is good to use when you don't plan to move your service elsewhere and you aren't planning on having constant usage on the server, otherwise it may be better touse a different service.
